A Twitch Chat Bot created with Python and SQlite3  

This project is not complete but it is at a basic and working state, I will be adding as much as I can to this bot and cleaning up the code in order to make it as powerful and as useful as I can.

------

## - Moderator Functions
The current working bot does not have any functionality to work with moderator groups or groups in general, this branch is focused on the work being put forward to that.  

Current plans with this branch:  
* *Giving commands usage groups.*
    - *!addcom !test !owner|moderator|everyone| [response]*
* *Let moderators add commands (if the channel owner chooses to allow it)*
